# PongAI

Python code for implementing an artificial intelligence that learns how to play a simple pong game. All the algorithms are based on neural networks.

Files:

- Game.py: Game class with the methods needed to start the game, it is used in the GameAI.py

- GameAI.py: Implements the A.I. by means of a Linear Neural Network based on reinforcement learning using Pytorch

- GameNEAT.py: Implements the A.I. by means of the NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies algorithm using the NEAT python library

- GameSP.py: If you want to play the pong game in single player mode.
